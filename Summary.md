# Summary of the Checklist Manifesto

## Why Need Checklists?
1. The complexity of our collective knowledge has surpassed our individual capacity.
2. Checklists lower the mistakes of "People Being People" i.e. minimize human error.
   1. We humans are flawed decision makers and have unreliable memories.
   2. Our attention to detail and memory are unreliable and often fail.
   3. We tend to skip steps even when we remember them.a
   4. For even the veterans that have the following, they fail at times:
      1. Training
      2. Experience
      3. Intelligence
3. Clearly defined and easy to follow checklists save lives.
   1. Minimum steps required are clearly highlighted even in the most complex of tasks.
   2. Checklists catch mental flaws inherent in all of us:
      1. Memory
      2. Attention
      3. Thoroughness
   3. The discipline to follow checklists will skyrocket productivity and minimize errors.

## How to Create A Good Checklists?
1. Define __A Clear Pause Point__ When the Checklist is Going to be Used
   1. A particular point in time when you know to pause and complete a checklist.
   2. Decide between a "Do-Confirm" or "Read-Do" list
      1. Do-Confirm: Do first and then confirm after.
      2. Read-Do: Doing the task in a step-by-step manner.
2. Keep the Checklist Short => __Speedy__.
   1. 5 to 9 "killer" items.
      1. Killer Item = If missed, will result in poor quality and could be a detriment to lives or an experience.
      2. Concentrate on the most important items i.e. most detrimental if missed.
   2. A quick to complete checklist.
   3. Keep the wording simple, precise and the terminology is resonant with the target audience.
3. __Supplement__ to Existing Knowledge or Expertise
   1. A good checklist shouldn't turn your brain off and turn you into a robot.
   2. Each item should be a concise reminder: a way of triggering a familiar routine.
4. __Field Tested and Updated__
   1. An ideal checklist is made up of past failures and lessons learnt for you to trust it more. 
   2. Real World Testing: Theory =/= Practice
   3. Use it yourself or have another person test it and provide feedback.

## How To Start?
1. Ask yourself: "What is the task that's causing the most amount of grief" or "What's the most important one?"
2. Take some time and come up with a checklist.
   1. You externalize the steps so, it frees up your mind.
   2. Don't overcomplicate it!
